# rlox ðŸ¦€
#### Yet another implementation of Lox in Rust, via _Robert Nystromâ€™s_ Crafting Interpreters
#

This is (an attempt at) a faithful, idiomatic re-implementation of Lox (which wass built in Java) built in Rust. More than anything, it's an exercise.  

# Usage
1. Clone and build
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/cachebag/rlox.git
cd rlox
cargo build --release
```
2. Run REPL (currently stateless)
```zsh
cargo run

> print "Hello, world!";
Hello, World!

> var msg = 10 != 100 ? "true" : "false"; print msg;
true
```
3. Run a `lox` file
```JavaScript
// examples/recursive_fib.lox
fn fib(n) {
  return n <= 1 ? n : fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1);
}

for (var i = 0; i < 20; i = i + 1) {
  print fib(i);
}
```

```bash
cargo run examples/recursive_fib.lox

0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
...
```
# Debug
You can print the tokens of a given file or `stdin` input.

```bash
cargo run show-tokens <file> # Scans the given file and prints its tokens.

cargo run show-tokens - # Reads from stdin and prints tokens.
```
You can also print the parsed AST for a given file or input.

```bash
cargo run show-ast <file> [output.txt] # Prints the parsed AST for the given file. (defaults to ast_output.txt if no name is given

cargo run show-ast - [output.txt] - # Stdin 
```
