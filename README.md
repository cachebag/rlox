# rlox 
#### Yet another implementation of `jlox` in Rust, via _Robert Nystromâ€™s_ Crafting Interpreters
#

This isn't a line-for-line port and most certainly not the most robust implementation but nonetheless, the goal is for a faithful, idiomatic re-implementation 
that tries to emphasize better error handling, clear separation of stages (scanning, parsing, interpreting), and extensibility toward bytecode compilation or static analysis in later phases.
