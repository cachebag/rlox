# OpenCode: rlox Codebase Guidelines

I am reading Crafting Intepreter's by Robert Nystrom and re-implementing it in Rust.

I am a new programmer, only with about a year of experience. So I am still new to many concepts and programming paradigms.

Please note that while I am re-implementing the Java version of lox, I am using many different approaches.

For example:
    - I do not use the visitor pattern. I simply pattern match on the enum
    - I do not have an AST generator script I have a pretty simple AST tree defined in `src/ast`
Always ask clarifying questions for me.
